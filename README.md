# event_search_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## Flutter Coding Task:

Help us understand how you think about building great software. We will look specifically at how you handle UI-implementation.

Summary

Requirements
1.Write a type ahead against the Seat Geek API - (search view with results – Search and Listing screen)
2.Make a detail screen so the user can drill down into a result
3.Include instructions for building the application and any relevant documentation in a README.md file
4.Please post your submission on Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab
5.Make this flutter app work for both iOS and Android platforms

Optional
1.Mac Desktop support
2.Micro-animations as well as animations between screens and states
3.The detail screen should allow the user to favorite/unfavorite the event
4.Type ahead results should reflect the favorited state of each event

Guidelines
The coding challenge will be judged on

API Information
The endpoint to use on Seat Geek is free and publicly accessible, but you will need to register for a Seat Geek account and obtain an API key to use it. Details can be found at http://platform.seatgeek.com/

You will pass in the url param of q which will correspond to the search query. For example, the below query will give a result set for the term Texas Ranger.
